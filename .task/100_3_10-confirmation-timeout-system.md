# Task: Confirmation Timeout System

**Task ID:** 100_3_10
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** medium
**Implementation Phase:** 3

## Problem Statement
Need user confirmation prompts with --yes override and per-state timeout management

## Description
Implement confirmation system using bash subprocess approach with configurable --yes flag override and per-state timeout enforcement in milliseconds.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- User confirmation prompts using bash subprocess approach
- Configurable --yes flag to bypass confirmations
- Per-state timeout configuration in milliseconds (0 = disabled)
- Timeout enforcement and process cleanup
- Progress indication and status reporting
- Integration with existing aisanity logging utilities

## Expected Outcome
Functional confirmation and timeout system that provides user interaction while maintaining performance

## Dependencies
command-executor-tui

## Integration Requirements
This task provides user interaction capabilities for the workflow system.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser
100_1_20 - fsm-core-engine
100_2_10 - command-executor-tui

**Expected Integrations:**
- Uses timeout configurations from YAML parser data
- Integrates with command executor for confirmation prompts
- Provides user interaction for CLI integration

**Integration Points:**
- Uses timeout definitions from yaml-workflow-parser
- Integrates with command-executor-tui for clean prompts
- Provides confirmation flow for CLI command interface

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Use bash subprocess per architectural decision, integrate with existing Logger, implement timeout management

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
