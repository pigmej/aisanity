# Task: FSM Core Engine

**Task ID:** 100_1_20
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** high
**Implementation Phase:** 1

## Problem Statement
Need custom finite state machine implementation without XState dependency

## Description
Build lightweight FSM engine that manages state transitions, execution context, and workflow flow. Must handle exit code-based routing and support both sequential and single-state execution modes.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Custom FSM implementation without external dependencies
- State definition and transition logic based on exit codes
- Execution context management for workflow data
- Support for sequential workflow execution
- Support for single-state execution mode
- State validation and transition verification
- Performance optimization for <500ms startup time

## Expected Outcome
Functional FSM engine that can execute workflows with proper state transitions and context management

## Dependencies
yaml-workflow-parser

## Integration Requirements
This task builds upon the YAML parser to create the core execution engine.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser

**Expected Integrations:**
- Consumes structured workflow data from YAML parser
- Provides execution context for command executor
- Manages state flow for confirmation system

**Integration Points:**
- Uses workflow definitions from yaml-workflow-parser
- Integrates with command executor for state execution
- Provides state management for CLI integration

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Custom implementation per architectural decision, focus on performance and simplicity, no XState dependency

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
