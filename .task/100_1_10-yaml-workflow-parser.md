# Task: YAML Workflow Parser

**Task ID:** 100_1_10
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** high
**Implementation Phase:** 1

## Problem Statement
Need to load and validate workflow definitions from .aisanity-workflows.yml file

## Description
Create a robust YAML parser that can load workflow definitions, validate schema, and provide structured data for the FSM engine. Must handle multiple named workflows and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Parse .aisanity-workflows.yml file from workspace root
- Validate workflow schema including states, transitions, commands, and timeouts
- Support multiple named workflows in single YAML file
- Provide clear validation error messages with line numbers
- Return structured TypeScript interfaces for workflow data
- Handle missing or malformed files gracefully

## Expected Outcome
Working YAML parser that can load and validate workflow configurations, returning structured data ready for FSM consumption

## Dependencies
None

## Integration Requirements
This is a foundational task that provides the data structure for all subsequent tasks.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
None

**Expected Integrations:**
- Provides structured workflow data to FSM engine
- Defines TypeScript interfaces used throughout the system

**Integration Points:**
- FSM engine will consume the parsed workflow data
- Command executor will use command definitions from parsed data
- Argument templater will use template definitions from parsed data

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Follow existing aisanity configuration patterns, use existing yaml dependency, implement schema validation without external libraries

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
