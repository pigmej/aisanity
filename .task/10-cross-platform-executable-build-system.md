# Task 10: Cross-Platform Executable Build System

## Description
Based on user feedback requesting a package build procedure for downloadable executables, this task focuses on creating cross-platform executable builds for macOS arm64, Linux, and Windows. The user specifically mentioned not wanting Docker containers and focusing only on standalone executables.

## Problem Statement
The current build system only produces TypeScript compilation output that requires Node.js to run. Users cannot easily download and run the tool without having Node.js installed, limiting distribution and adoption.

## Requirements
1. Create standalone executables for three target platforms:
   - macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
   - Linux x64
   - Windows x64
2. Use `pkg` tool for Node.js executable bundling
3. Executables should include Node.js runtime and all dependencies
4. No Docker container builds required
5. Integration with existing TypeScript build process
6. GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
7. Clear installation instructions for each platform

## Expected Outcome
1. Enhanced package.json with new build scripts:
   - `package` - builds all platforms
   - `package:macos` - macOS arm64 only
   - `package:linux` - Linux x64 only
   - `package:windows` - Windows x64 only
2. GitHub Actions workflow that builds and uploads executables to releases
3. Standalone executables that users can download and run directly
4. Updated documentation with installation instructions

## Additional Suggestions and Ideas
- Consider adding checksum verification for downloads
- Explore code signing for macOS executables
- Add version information to executables
- Create simple installation scripts for each platform

## Other Important Agreements
- Target Node.js version 24 (matches current project version)
- Use `pkg` as the recommended bundling tool due to excellent cross-platform support
- Output naming convention: `aisanity-{platform}-{arch}` (e.g., `aisanity-macos-arm64`, `aisanity-linux-x64`, `aisanity-win-x64.exe`)
- Maintain existing npm package functionality alongside new executables
- Focus on user experience: executables should work out-of-the-box without additional dependencies
