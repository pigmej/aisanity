# Task: Testing Documentation

**Task ID:** 100_4_20
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** medium
**Implementation Phase:** 4

## Problem Statement
Need comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Description
Create thorough test suite following existing aisanity patterns and provide clear documentation with examples for workflow definition and usage.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- Follow existing aisanity test patterns
- Integration tests for complete workflow execution
- Documentation with workflow examples
- Usage examples and best practices
- Performance validation for <500ms startup requirement

## Expected Outcome
Complete test suite and documentation that ensures reliability and usability

## Dependencies
error-handling-logging

## Integration Requirements
This task validates and documents the entire workflow system.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser
100_1_20 - fsm-core-engine
100_2_10 - command-executor-tui
100_2_20 - argument-templating-system
100_3_10 - confirmation-timeout-system
100_3_20 - cli-command-integration
100_4_10 - error-handling-logging

**Expected Integrations:**
- Tests all workflow components comprehensively
- Documents usage patterns and examples
- Validates performance requirements
- Ensures reliability across all scenarios

**Integration Points:**
- Tests yaml-workflow-parser with various workflow configurations
- Validates FSM engine state transitions and execution
- Tests command executor with different command types
- Validates argument templating security and functionality
- Tests confirmation system with various timeout scenarios
- Validates CLI integration and error handling
- Tests error handling across all components

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Follow existing test patterns, provide comprehensive examples, validate performance requirements

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
