# Task: Command Executor TUI

**Task ID:** 100_2_10
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** high
**Implementation Phase:** 2

## Problem Statement
Need to execute commands with proper exit code capture and TUI program support

## Description
Implement command execution layer that can spawn processes, capture exit codes, and handle interactive TUI programs without terminal pollution using bash subprocess approach.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Execute commands using Bun's $ and Bun.spawn for optimal performance
- Capture and route based on command exit codes (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- TUI program support via bash subprocess pattern for confirmations
- Prevent terminal pollution with readline libraries
- Process monitoring and timeout enforcement
- Error handling and cleanup for failed processes

## Expected Outcome
Robust command executor that can handle both regular commands and interactive TUI programs cleanly

## Dependencies
fsm-core-engine

## Integration Requirements
This task provides the execution capability for the FSM engine.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser
100_1_20 - fsm-core-engine

**Expected Integrations:**
- Executes commands defined in workflow data from YAML parser
- Provides exit code routing to FSM engine
- Supports TUI interactions for confirmation system

**Integration Points:**
- Uses command definitions from yaml-workflow-parser data
- Integrates with FSM engine for state-based execution
- Provides clean execution environment for TUI programs

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Use bash subprocess approach per architectural decision, leverage Bun runtime integration, ensure clean TUI support

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
