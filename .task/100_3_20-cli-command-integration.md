# Task: CLI Command Integration

**Task ID:** 100_3_20
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** low
**Implementation Phase:** 3

## Problem Statement
Need to integrate workflow state machine with existing aisanity CLI structure

## Description
Create CLI command interface that follows existing aisanity patterns with proper command registration, argument parsing, help system, and integration with commander framework.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- CLI command: aisanity state execute <workflow_name> <state> [args]
- Integration with existing commander framework
- Argument parsing and validation
- Help system and usage documentation
- Error handling with actionable messages
- Integration with existing aisanity command structure

## Expected Outcome
Fully integrated CLI command that follows aisanity patterns and provides intuitive user experience

## Dependencies
fsm-core-engine, confirmation-timeout-system

## Integration Requirements
This task provides the user interface for the entire workflow system.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser
100_1_20 - fsm-core-engine
100_2_10 - command-executor-tui
100_2_20 - argument-templating-system
100_3_10 - confirmation-timeout-system

**Expected Integrations:**
- Orchestrates all components for complete workflow execution
- Provides user interface for FSM engine functionality
- Integrates argument templating with CLI parameters

**Integration Points:**
- Uses workflow data from yaml-workflow-parser
- Orchestrates FSM engine for state execution
- Integrates command executor for running commands
- Uses argument templating for parameter processing
- Incorporates confirmation system for user interaction

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Follow existing aisanity command patterns, use commander framework, integrate with existing utilities

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
