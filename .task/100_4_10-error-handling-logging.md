# Task: Error Handling Logging

**Task ID:** 100_4_10
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** medium
**Implementation Phase:** 4

## Problem Statement
Need comprehensive error handling and logging integration

## Description
Implement robust error handling throughout the system with clear error messages, proper exit codes, and integration with existing aisanity logging utilities.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Clear error messages with actionable information
- Proper exit codes for different failure scenarios
- Integration with existing aisanity Logger utilities
- Graceful error handling and cleanup
- No retry mechanisms per architectural decision
- Consistent error reporting across all components

## Expected Outcome
Comprehensive error handling system that provides clear feedback and integrates seamlessly with aisanity

## Dependencies
cli-command-integration

## Integration Requirements
This task provides robust error handling for the entire workflow system.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser
100_1_20 - fsm-core-engine
100_2_10 - command-executor-tui
100_2_20 - argument-templating-system
100_3_10 - confirmation-timeout-system
100_3_20 - cli-command-integration

**Expected Integrations:**
- Provides error handling for all workflow components
- Integrates with existing aisanity logging system
- Ensures consistent error reporting across CLI interface

**Integration Points:**
- Enhances yaml-workflow-parser with validation error handling
- Integrates with FSM engine for state transition errors
- Provides error handling for command executor failures
- Handles argument templating validation errors
- Manages confirmation system timeout errors
- Ensures CLI integration error consistency

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Use existing aisanity Logger, focus on clear error messages, no retries per architectural decision

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
