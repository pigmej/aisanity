# Task: Argument Templating System

**Task ID:** 100_2_20
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** medium
**Implementation Phase:** 2

## Problem Statement
Need to substitute {branch} and pass CLI parameters to workflow commands

## Description
Create argument templating system that can substitute placeholders like {branch} and pass CLI arguments to all commands in the workflow while validating inputs and preventing injection.

This task is part of a larger feature. Please review the feature architecture before implementation.

## Requirements
- Substitute {branch} placeholder in command templates
- Pass CLI parameters to all workflow commands
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection
- Support for multiple argument types and formats
- Error handling for invalid template substitutions
- Integration with existing aisanity argument patterns

## Expected Outcome
Working argument templating system that safely substitutes variables and passes parameters to workflow commands

## Dependencies
yaml-workflow-parser

## Integration Requirements
This task provides dynamic argument handling for workflow commands.

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_1_10 - yaml-workflow-parser

**Expected Integrations:**
- Processes command templates from YAML parser data
- Provides substituted arguments to command executor
- Validates CLI parameters from command integration

**Integration Points:**
- Uses template definitions from yaml-workflow-parser
- Integrates with command executor for argument substitution
- Validates parameters from CLI command interface

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT hardcode data, duplicate functionality, or create temporary implementations if prior tasks provide the proper foundation. Always review prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md` before implementation planning.

## Architectural Notes
Custom string replacement implementation, focus on security and validation, lightweight approach

**IMPORTANT:** This task must align with the feature architecture at `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing this task:
1. Review the parent feature architecture first
2. If this task has dependencies, review ALL prior task plans at `./.plan/{prior-task-id}-*.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with other tasks in this feature
4. Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the feature architecture
5. Properly integrate with prior work - avoid hardcoding or duplicating existing functionality
6. Consider the dependencies and implementation phase
