# Task: Reduce Security Overhead for Development

**Task ID:** 100_3_40
**Parent Feature:** 100 - See `./.feature/100-workflow-state-machine.md`
**Feature Architecture:** `./.feature/arch_100_workflow-state-machine.md`
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Priority:** medium
**Implementation Phase:** 4

## Problem Statement

The current security implementation treats workflows as potentially dangerous code requiring extensive validation, creating unnecessary friction for legitimate development workflows. The command whitelist and injection prevention are overly restrictive for a development tool.

## Description

Remove command whitelist and reduce injection prevention restrictions to make Aisanity a more flexible development tool. The current sandbox-like security approach conflicts with the need for developers to run arbitrary commands and access files outside the immediate directory.

## Requirements

- Remove command whitelist validation from CommandExecutor
- Modify template injection prevention to allow development patterns (like `../`)
- Keep essential security: timeouts, process limits, and basic template validation
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Ensure the system is more permissive for development workflows

## Expected Outcome

Aisanity becomes a powerful development tool with minimal security overhead:
- Developers can run any command they need
- File operations with `../` work without restrictions
- Template injection prevention focuses on truly dangerous patterns only
- Core protections (timeouts, process limits) remain intact

## Integration Requirements

This task modifies the security layer that integrates with:
- CommandExecutor for command validation
- ArgumentTemplater for template processing
- CLI command integration for workflow execution

**Prior Tasks This Builds Upon:**
100_2_20 - argument-templating-system
100_3_20 - cli-command-integration
100_3_30 - fix-dry-run-functionality

**Expected Integrations:**
- Modified CommandExecutor validation
- Updated ArgumentTemplater injection patterns
- CLI integration with reduced restrictions

## Additional Suggestions

Consider removing or making optional:
- Command whitelist entirely
- Directory traversal restrictions (`../`)
- Shell metacharacter blocking in development mode
- Working directory scope restrictions

Keep:
- Template validation for code injection
- Process timeouts and resource limits
- Basic error handling and logging

## Other Important Agreements

This task addresses the design philosophy shift from "sandbox security" to "development tool security". The system should trust developers to know what they're running while preventing accidental issues. Template injection prevention should remain but be less restrictive for legitimate development workflows.

The goal is to remove artificial barriers that prevent developers from doing their work while maintaining essential protections against genuine security issues.
