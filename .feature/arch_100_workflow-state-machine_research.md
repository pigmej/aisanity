# Workflow State Machine Research & Analysis

## Research Findings

### Industry Practices for Workflow Automation

#### GitHub Actions Model
GitHub Actions has established a dominant pattern for YAML-based workflow automation:
- **Declarative YAML syntax** with jobs, steps, and runner configuration
- **Event-driven triggers** (push, pull_request, manual, scheduled)
- **Matrix strategies** for parallel execution across multiple configurations
- **Built-in secret management** and environment variable handling
- **Artifact sharing** between jobs and steps
- **Conditional execution** based on expressions and exit codes

**Key Insights:**
- YAML configuration is widely adopted and understood by developers
- Exit code-based conditional flow is standard practice
- Matrix strategies, while powerful, add complexity not needed for this use case
- Secret management is critical for security but out of scope for this feature

#### State Machine Patterns
Research into state machine implementations reveals several approaches:

**XState v5 (Actor-based State Management):**
- Comprehensive state machine and statecharts implementation
- Actor model for complex orchestration
- Visual design tools and debugging capabilities
- TypeScript-first design with excellent type safety
- **Trade-off**: Powerful but heavy (28.8k stars, significant bundle size)

**Custom Lightweight FSM:**
- Simple state transition tables
- Event-driven architecture
- Minimal dependencies and fast execution
- **Trade-off**: Less feature-rich but optimized for performance

**Finite State Machine Best Practices:**
- Define clear states and transitions
- Handle edge cases and error states explicitly
- Use deterministic state transitions
- Implement proper state validation

#### Command Execution Patterns

**Process Spawning Approaches:**
1. **Child Process.spawn**: Node.js standard, cross-platform
2. **Bun.spawn()**: Native Bun integration, better performance
3. **Shell Execution**: Simple but potential security risks

**TUI Handling Research:**
- **Readline libraries**: Can cause terminal state pollution
- **Bash subprocess approach**: Cleaner terminal state, widely used in scripts
- **PTY (pseudo-terminal)**: Complex but offers full terminal emulation

**Security Considerations:**
- Command injection prevention through argument validation
- Shell escaping for user-provided inputs
- Restricted execution environments

### YAML Configuration Patterns

#### Workflow Definition Schema
Based on industry best practices, effective workflow YAML should include:

```yaml
workflows:
  feature-development:
    initial: setup
    states:
      setup:
        command: "npm install"
        timeout: 30000
        on:
          success: test
          failure: cleanup
      test:
        command: "npm test"
        timeout: 60000
        on:
          success: build
          failure: cleanup
      build:
        command: "npm run build"
        timeout: 45000
        on:
          success: deploy
          failure: cleanup
      cleanup:
        command: "git reset --hard"
        timeout: 10000
        on:
          success: null  # Terminal state
          failure: null
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- Explicit state definitions with clear entry/exit conditions
- Timeout configurations for reliability
- Success/failure transition paths
- Terminal states for workflow completion

#### Argument Templating Patterns
Common templating approaches:
1. **Simple string replacement**: `{branch}` → current branch name
2. **Environment variable injection**: `$BRANCH` or `${BRANCH}`
3. **Template engines**: Handlebars, Mustache (overkill for this use case)

**Recommendation**: Simple string replacement for performance and simplicity

## Deep Dive Analysis

### Scalability Considerations

#### Workflow Complexity Scaling
- **Current Requirements**: Support for 5-10 state workflows
- **Future Growth**: Architecture should handle 50+ state workflows
- **Performance Impact**: Linear state transition time, minimal memory overhead
- **Bottlenecks**: Command execution time, not FSM overhead

#### Concurrent Execution Analysis
- **Current Design**: Single workflow execution per command
- **Future Considerations**: Architecture allows for future parallel execution
- **Resource Management**: Each workflow runs in isolated process context
- **State Isolation**: No shared state between workflow instances

### Security Analysis

#### Command Injection Prevention
```typescript
// Safe argument validation
function validateArguments(args: string[]): boolean {
  const dangerousPatterns = [
    /[;&|`$(){}[\]]/,  // Shell metacharacters
    /\.\./,           // Path traversal
    /^\s*rm\s+/i,     // Dangerous commands
  ];
  
  return !args.some(arg => 
    dangerousPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(arg))
  );
}
```

#### Path Traversal Protection
- Restrict file access to current working directory
- Validate all file path inputs
- Use absolute path resolution
- Implement allow-list for safe directories

#### Timeout Enforcement
- Per-state timeout prevents infinite loops
- Global workflow timeout as safety net
- Graceful cleanup on timeout
- Resource cleanup on process termination

### Performance Analysis

#### Startup Time Optimization
- **YAML Parsing**: <50ms with `yaml` library
- **FSM Initialization**: <10ms for simple workflows
- **Command Setup**: <100ms for process preparation
- **Total Target**: <500ms as specified

#### Memory Usage Profile
- **YAML Configuration**: <1MB for typical workflows
- **FSM State**: <100KB per active workflow
- **Process Overhead**: Standard Node.js/Bun memory usage
- **Total Impact**: Minimal compared to command execution

#### Execution Flow Performance
```
YAML Load → FSM Init → State Execute → Exit Code → Transition → Next State
   5ms        2ms       Variable      1ms         1ms         1ms
```

Command execution time dominates overall performance, FSM overhead is negligible.

### Error Handling Strategy

#### Validation Errors
- YAML syntax validation with clear error messages
- State transition validation (no undefined states)
- Command existence validation
- Timeout value validation

#### Runtime Errors
- Command failure handling with exit code routing
- Timeout enforcement with graceful cleanup
- Process termination handling
- Resource cleanup on errors

#### Recovery Strategies
- No state persistence (as per requirements)
- Clean termination on errors
- Meaningful error messages for debugging
- Exit code propagation for scripting integration
